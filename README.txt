Welcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world. There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. As a consultant to I will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx (Excel files).

## Objective

As a consultant, I will be analyzing the available New York Airbnb market data to provide insights to real estate market trends for the fictional real estate company. Specifically: 

- Determine the earliest and most recent review dates. 
- Find out how many listings are private rooms. 
- Find the average price of listings. 

Once these have been determined, I'll compile the values into a tibble called "review_dates"

## Stakeholders

As mentioned, this is a project working as a consultant to a fictional real estate company.
